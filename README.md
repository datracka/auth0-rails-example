# Login
[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails/01-login)

This example shows how to add login capabilities to your Rails application using the Auth0's hosted login page and the OmniAuth authentication system. It also shows how to prevent users from executing controller actions unless they're authenticated.

## Running the Sample Application
In order to run the example you need to have ruby installed.

Register `http://localhost:3000/auth/auth0/callback` as `Allowed Callback URLs` in your client setting in [Auth0's dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/).

You also need to set the Client Secret, Client ID, Domain and Callback URL for your Auth0 app as environment variables with the following names respectively: `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL`.

Set the environment variables in `.env` to match those in your Auth0 Application Settings.

````bash
# .env file
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<YOUR_TENANT>.auth0.com
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/auth0/callback
````
Once you've set those 4 environment variables, run `bundle install` and then `rails s`. Now, browse [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
__Note:__ Remember that you need to have `./bin` in your path for `rails s` to work.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

__Note:__ If you are using Windows, uncomment the `tzinfo-data` gem in the gemfile.

## Running the Sample Application With Docker
In order to run the example you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#running-the-sample-application).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
